# Operating Systems Course

This repository contains a collection of projects and tasks related to operating systems. These exercises are designed to provide hands-on experience with the core concepts, mechanisms, and functionalities of modern operating systems.

## Contents

- **Process Management**: Programs demonstrating process creation, scheduling, synchronization, and inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms such as semaphores, mutexes, and message passing.
- **Memory Management**: Exercises on memory allocation techniques, paging, segmentation, and virtual memory.
- **File Systems**: Implementation and manipulation of file systems, file operations, directory structures, and file system management.
- **Concurrency**: Handling concurrency in operating systems, including threading, deadlock prevention, and avoidance techniques.
- **Input/Output (I/O) Systems**: Understanding and implementing I/O management, device drivers, and interrupt handling.
- **Scheduling Algorithms**: Implementation of various CPU scheduling algorithms such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), and Round Robin (RR).
- **Virtualization**: Basics of virtualization, virtual machines, and the role of hypervisors.
- **Security and Protection**: Exercises on access control, authentication, authorization, and other security mechanisms in operating systems.

## Objectives

- To gain practical knowledge of operating system concepts and functionalities.
- To understand and implement various operating system mechanisms and services.
- To develop the ability to design and build components of an operating system.
- To understand the importance of concurrency, synchronization, and security in operating systems.
