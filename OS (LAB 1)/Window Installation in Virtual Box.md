## Virtual Box : 

​				VirtualBox is a type of software that allows you to run multiple operating  systems on a single device, effectively creating a computer within a computer.  These additional systems are known as virtual machines. It’s used for various  purposes, such as software development and testing, and can be installed on any  Intel- or AMD-powered computer.

VMware Workstation Player is  recognized as a virtualization  solution that supports a variety of  operating systems on a single  machine without requiring a reboot.  It allows for seamless data sharing  between hosts and guests and is  designed for IT professionals.
